            <h2>Here is a time line of some important events from the Great Migration:</h2>
            <h3></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>1900</strong>- more than 90% of the Black population in the U.S. lives in the American South
                </li>
                <li>

                <li>
                    <strong>1930s and 1940s</strong>- Many Black farmers are forced off of land in the South due to
                    mechnanization of farming. More than 1 million Black southerners move to cities in the North and
                    West as a result.
                </li>
                <li>
